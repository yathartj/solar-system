<h1 style="font-size:1.4em;text-align:center;">TRIP TO SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
<p style=" text-align:center;line-height: 32px;">This will be a new expereince for you. Solar system will explain itself.<br>
 Our goal is to help students in their studies by robotics</p>
<hr>
<h2 style="font-size:1.4em;text-align:center;">STAR OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sun: "Hey there! I’m the Sun, the center of this whole show.<br> I’m a giant ball of glowing gas, mostly hydrogen and helium, and I provide the light and heat that make life possible on the planets around me.<br> Without me, this solar system would be a cold, dark place.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:1.4em;text-align:center;">PLANETS</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Mercury: "Hi, I’m Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun.<br> I’m tiny and a bit of a hot mess with extreme temperature changes—hot days and freezing nights.<br> I’ve got a rocky surface and lots of craters, thanks to not having much of an atmosphere to protect me.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Venus: "Greetings! I’m Venus, the second planet from the Sun.<br> I’ve got a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making me the hottest planet in the solar system.<br> My surface is covered in volcanoes and I’ve got some seriously crushing pressure.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Earth: "Hello! I’m Earth, the third planet from the Sun and the only one known to support life.<br> I’ve got a perfect mix of air, water, and land.<br> My diverse climates and ecosystems make me quite the vibrant home for all sorts of creatures.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Mars: "Hey! I’m Mars, the fourth planet and often called the Red Planet because of my iron oxide dust.<br> I’ve got the tallest volcano and the deepest canyon in the solar system.<br> I’m a bit chilly, but there’s a lot of interest in my past and potential for future exploration.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Jupiter: "Greetings, I’m Jupiter, the largest planet around here.<br> I’m a gas giant with a massive storm system known as the Great Red Spot.<br> I’ve got a bunch of moons and a powerful magnetic field.<br> I’m like the heavyweight champion of this solar system.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Saturn: "Hi there! I’m Saturn, famous for my spectacular rings.<br> I’m a gas giant like Jupiter, but with a more elegant look thanks to my rings made of ice and rock particles.<br> I also have a bunch of moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Uranus: "Hello! I’m Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun.<br> I’m unique because I rotate on my side, which gives me extreme seasonal variations.<br> I’m an ice giant with a cold, windy atmosphere and a faint ring system.
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Neptune: "Hey, I’m Neptune, the eighth planet and the farthest from the Sun. I’m known for my deep blue color and strong winds.<br> My atmosphere has dark storms, and I’m another ice giant with a system of rings and a few moons.
<h2 style="font-size:1.4em;text-align:center;">DWARF PLANETS</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Pluto: Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet.<br> It has a complex surface with mountains, plains, and a large heart-shaped glacier.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Eris: Located in the scattered disk, Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto but more massive.<br> It has a highly eccentric orbit and is known for its bright, icy surface.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Haumea: Found in the Kuiper Belt, Haumea is notable for its elongated shape due to its rapid rotation.<br> It has two known moons and a ring system.
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;">Makemake: Another resident of the Kuiper Belt, Makemake is one of the largest known dwarf planets.<br> It has a surface covered with methane ice.
